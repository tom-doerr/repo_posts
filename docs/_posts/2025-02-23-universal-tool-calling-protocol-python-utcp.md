# [universal-tool-calling-protocol/python-utcp](https://github.com/universal-tool-calling-protocol/)

The Universal Tool Calling Protocol (UTCP) is an open, secure tool-calling alternative to MCP, that describes how to call existing tools rather than proxying those calls through a new server. After discovery, the agent speaks directly to the tool’s native endpoint (HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, CLI, …), eliminating the “wrapper tax,” reducing latency, and letting you keep your existing auth, billing and security in place.
